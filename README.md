# Escape Room Game
*A simple text-based escape room game using Python OOP*

## Game Overview
This is a **console-based escape room game** built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python**.  
It consists of **three levels**, each requiring the player to solve a different type of challenge:

1. **Math Challenge Room** – Solve basic math problems.  
2. **Science Puzzle Room** – Answer science-based questions.  
3. **Riddle Room** – Solve tricky riddles.  

Each level presents a **pre-set question**, and players must enter the correct answer to progress.  
If they enter a wrong answer, they can request a **hint**.

## Features
